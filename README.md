Cloud Fortress Prime — AWS Security & CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM Integration
🚀 Project Overview

Cloud Fortress Prime is a secure, production-ready AWS environment designed to centralize threat detection and accelerate incident response. It integrates multiple log sources into CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM, applies infrastructure as code, and leverages AI/ML-powered AWS services to deliver enterprise-grade security monitoring, automation, and compliance alignment.

🏗️ Architecture Overview

The architecture includes:

AWS Infrastructure: Multi-tier VPCs, IAM least privilege, encrypted storage, secrets management (KMS, Secrets Manager).

Log Sources: GitHub, AWS CloudTrail, Google Workspace, JumpCloud SSO, Sophos Firewall, HP Switches & Access Points.

SIEM: Centralized ingestion into CrowdStrike Falcon.

SOAR Automation: AWS Lambda + EventBridge for automated response workflows.

AI/ML Security: Amazon Macie (sensitive data discovery), AWS Detective (ML-driven investigation), and Security Hub (aggregated findings + dashboards).

🔑 Key Features

Multi-tier VPC with IAM least privilege for secure cloud segmentation.

CI/CD pipelines with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Amazon ECR for streamlined deployments.

AWS GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Security Hub, and Detective integrated for unified threat detection.

CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM ingestion from seven critical log sources.

Automated SOAR workflows with AWS Lambda & EventBridge for faster incident remediation.

Infrastructure as Code with Terraform for scalable, repeatable deployments.

AI/ML integration (Amazon Macie, AWS Detective) for advanced detection & response.

Compliance-ready controls documented for GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 audit alignment.

🤖 AI/ML & Advanced Security Enhancements

Amazon Macie: Automated discovery/classification of sensitive data to reduce exposure risks.

AWS Detective: ML-driven insights for faster root cause analysis of findings.

AWS Security Hub: Unified posture dashboard with automated playbooks.

Future Enhancements: AI-driven anomaly detection for continuous improvement.

📅 Project Progress & Milestones

✅ Day 1 — Setup: IAM, CloudWatch, Billing, CLI/Tools installation.

✅ Day 2 — Terraform Backend Mastery: Remote state with S3 & DynamoDB (encrypted, secure).

🔜 Day 3+: Core infrastructure deployment (VPC, networking, compute), advanced security integration.

Full daily logs available in docs/daily-logs/
