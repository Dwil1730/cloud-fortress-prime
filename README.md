# Cloud Fortress Prime ‚Äî Enterprise Cloud Security & AI-Driven Architecture Initiative üöÄ
[ Status: Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow)

**Organization:** U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  
**Duration:** July 28 ‚Äì August 12, 2025 (resumed August 19, 2025)  
**Scope:** Design, implement, and validate a secure, automated AWS cloud environment integrating **enterprise firewalls, AI/ML monitoring, DLP, and CI/CD automation**.

## **Mission**
Cloud Fortress Prime delivers a **fully architected, enterprise-grade AWS cloud environment** integrating:

- Palo Alto NGFW for perimeter security  
- Netskope-style DLP for sensitive data protection  
- AI/ML monitoring with AWS Macie and Detective  
- Automated CI/CD pipelines and SOAR workflows (Lambda + EventBridge)  
- Compliance alignment (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)  

The initiative demonstrates **scalable, secure, auditable cloud deployments** aligned with VA IT security and operational objectives.

## Key Highlights (Completed So Far)
- Integrated **Palo Alto NGFW** for enterprise perimeter protection  
- Implemented **multi-tier VPC architecture** with public/private subnets and NAT gateways  
- Automated **CI/CD pipelines** and **incident response workflows** with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Lambda  
- Leveraged **AI/ML monitoring** for threat detection and data classification (Macie, Detective)  
- Produced **enterprise-grade architecture diagrams, playbooks, and documentation**  
- Established **repeatable, scalable, and auditable cloud security framework**

---

## Current Focus**
**Phase 4 ‚Äì Security Services (Part 1)**  

- Audit logging via **CloudTrail**  
- Sensitive data discovery & classification via **AWS Macie**  
- DLP simulations and compliance validation  
- Documenting **security controls, audit trails, and remediation guidance**

---

## Next Steps
1. Complete Security Services phases (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detective, SOAR automation)  
2. Integrate logs and findings into **Falcon SIEM** for central correlation and analyst triage  
3. Conduct **SOAR testing and incident simulations**  
4. Finalize **architecture diagrams, documentation, and executive demo**
