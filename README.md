Cloud Fortress Prime â€” Enterprise AWS  Cloud & Security Architecture ðŸš€

Senior Cloud Security Architecture Deliverable (In-Progress)

Cloud Fortress Prime is an enterprise-grade AWS environment demonstrating best practices in cloud architecture, automation, and security. It integrates centralized SIEM, automated response workflows, AI/ML-driven threat detection, and compliance alignment (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) in a hands-on, enterprise-ready build.

Executive Snapshot:

- Current Focus: Perimeter & firewall implementation (Palo Alto + VPC/provisioning)

- Planned Enhancements: Multi-tier EC2 deployment, DLP & sensitive data classification (Macie), automated SOAR workflows (EventBridge + Lambda), Falcon SIEM ingestion, AI/ML anomaly detection & predictive threat modeling.
- Key Outcomes: Demonstrates scalable cloud deployment, automated monitoring, security best practices, and audit-ready compliance reporting

Core Flow:

Inbound Traffic â†’ Palo Alto Firewall â†’ ALB â†’ EC2 â†’ CloudTrail/GuardDuty â†’ Macie â†’ Security Hub â†’ EventBridge/Lambda â†’ Falcon SIEM â†’ Audit Dashboard

ðŸ”„ Data & Security Flows (mapped to diagram arrows):

1. Inbound Traffic â†’ Palo Alto Firewall (filters + enforces perimeter rules)

2. Allowed Traffic â†’ ALB â†’ EC2 Instances (application layer)

3. App Activity â†’ CloudTrail + GuardDuty (auditing + threat detection)

4. Sensitive Data â†’ Macie â†’ Security Hub (classification + central findings)

5. Incidents â†’ EventBridge â†’ Lambda (SOAR automated response playbooks)

6. All Logs/Findings â†’ Falcon SIEM (central correlation + analyst triage)

7. Compliance Overlays â†’ Audit Dashboard (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 reporting)

Key Features 

- Defense-in-Depth: Perimeter firewall, IAM least privilege, encryption, monitoring, automated response
- Automation by Default: Terraform IaC, Lambda/EventBridge workflows, CI/CD pipelines
- AI/ML Security: Macie (data discovery/classification), Detective (ML-driven investigation)
- Compliance-Ready: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 alignment; audit-ready dashboards
- Centralized Analytics: Falcon SIEM ingestion for log correlation, triage, and proactive threat detection
- Secure Cloud Segmentation: Multi-tier VPCs with public/private subnets and NAT gateways
- Firewall & DLP Simulation: Palo Alto rules + Netskope-style data security controls

Demo / Proof-of-Concept (Work in Progress)
- Current Implementation: Palo Alto firewall deployed; traffic filtering validated; VPC, subnets, and security groups provisioned via Terraform
- Planned Enhancements: EC2 app deployment behind ALB, Macie DLP and data classification, automated SOAR workflows (EventBridge + Lambda), Falcon SIEM ingestion, AI/ML anomaly detection

Business Value
- Reduces risk & accelerates audits
- Enables secure scaling of cloud workloads
- Combines AWS-native and third-party security tools for enterprise-grade protection
- Automates incident detection, response, and compliance reporting

Project Progress & Roadmap
- Phase 1 â€“ Core Infrastructure (Completed): Multi-tier VPC, public/private subnets, NAT gateways, EC2 instances, security groups, baseline connectivity
- Phase 2 â€“ Firewall & Network Security (Current): Palo Alto firewall, stateless/stateful rule groups, GuardDuty/CloudTrail/Security Hub integration
- Phase 3 â€“ DLP & Data Security (Upcoming): Macie/Netskope-style rules, data classification, compliance dashboards
- Future Enhancements: Automated SOAR, AI/ML threat modeling, anomaly detection, compliance optimization
