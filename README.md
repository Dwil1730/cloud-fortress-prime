Cloud Fortress Prime — AWS Security & CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM Integration 🚀

Enterprise-grade AWS security environment with centralized SIEM, automated response, AI/ML threat detection, and compliance alignment (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).

🏗️ Project Overview

Cloud Fortress Prime is a secure, production-ready AWS environment designed to centralize threat detection, accelerate incident response, and maintain compliance. It integrates multiple log sources into CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM, leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and incorporates AI/ML-powered AWS services for advanced monitoring, automation, and security insights.

📊 Architecture Overview

AWS Infrastructure

Multi-tier VPCs, IAM least privilege

Encrypted storage with KMS, Secrets Manager

Log Sources

GitHub, AWS CloudTrail, Google Workspace, JumpCloud SSO

Sophos Firewall, HP Switches & Access Points

Security & Automation

Centralized ingestion into CrowdStrike Falcon SIEM

Automated response workflows with AWS Lambda + EventBridge

AI/ML Security

Amazon Macie — automated discovery/classification of sensitive data → reduces exposure risks, supports GDPR/HIPAA compliance

AWS Detective — ML-driven investigation → faster root cause analysis of incidents

AWS Security Hub — unified posture dashboard with automated playbooks
