 📋 Executive Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Challenge | Secure multi-tier network with zero-trust principles |
| Solution | Multi-tier VPC, microsegmentation, high-availability NAT gateways |

| Impact | 100% tier isolation, reduced attack surface, compliance-ready architecture |


 🎯 Business Challenge

Modern enterprise applications face significant security challenges:

- Lateral Movement Risk: Flat networks enable attackers to move freely between systems
- Attack Surface Exposure: Unrestricted internet access increases vulnerability
- Compliance Gaps**: Manual security group management creates audit findings
- Scalability Constraints: Legacy architectures don't scale with business growth

 🏗️ Technical Architecture
 Network Design
 
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
- Public Subnets (Web Tier)
  - 10.0.1.0/24 (AZ-1a)
  - 10.0.2.0/24 (AZ-1b)
- Private Subnets (App Tier)  
   - 10.0.10.0/24 (AZ-1a)
   - 10.0.20.0/24 (AZ-1b)
- Database Subnets (Data Tier)
    - 10.0.100.0/24 (AZ-1a)
    - 10.0.200.0/24 (AZ-1b)

Security Groups Architecture

 - Web Tier SG:
   - Inbound: HTTPS (443) from Internet
   - Inbound: HTTP (80) from ALB
   - Outbound: App ports to App Tier only
- App Tier SG
   - Inbound: App ports from Web Tier only
   - Outbound: DB ports to DB Tier only
   - Outbound: HTTPS to internet via NAT
- DB Tier SG
    - Inbound: DB ports from App Tier only
    - Outbound: None (isolated)

🎯 50% reduction in security group complexity

🛠️ Implementation Code

Terraform VPC Configuration

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "zero-trust-vpc"
    Environment = "production"
    Project     = "zero-trust-architecture"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count                   = 2
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.${count.index + 1}.0/24"
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true

  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-${count.index + 1}"
    Type = "Public"
  }
}

📚 Key Learnings

What Worked Well

- Planning subnet CIDRs first prevented redesign
- Security groups before apps ensured clean deployment
- Consistent naming reduced operational complexity
- Comprehensive testing caught issues early

Future Enhancements

 - VPC Flow Logs for traffic monitoring
