# 2025-07-29 – Terraform backend

## What I worked on
- Created an S3 bucket to store Terraform remote state for the Zero-Trust VPC and future phases.
- Created a DynamoDB table to use for Terraform state locking.
- Wired the backend configuration into the Terraform backend "s3" block and ran terraform init.

## Issues I ran into
- Confusion over matching regions between the S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and the Terraform provider.
- Terraform initially failed to access the state bucket/lock table due to missing IAM permissions.

## How I debugged / fixed it
- Double-checked the regions for S3 and DynamoDB and aligned them with the Terraform provider config.
- Updated the IAM policy until terraform plan and terraform apply worked cleanly with remote state enabled.

## Notes / next steps
- Next: start building the core networking for the Zero-Trust case study (VPC, subnets, routing, NAT).
