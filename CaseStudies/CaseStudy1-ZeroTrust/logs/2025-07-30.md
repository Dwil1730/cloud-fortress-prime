# 2025-07-30 – Zero Trust VPC, day 1

## What I worked on
- Took the VA EHRM pain points (flat PHI network, manual SG edits, audit pain) and turned them into concrete goals for this project.
- Designed the VPC CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 and planned subnet layout for web, app, and database tiers across two AZs.
- Created the VPC and all subnets (public, private, and database) in Terraform.
- Sketched the initial security group model so that web → app → db is the only allowed path.

## Issues I ran into
- First SG draft accidentally allowed 0.0.0.0/0 on some ports, making things more open than intended.
- Realized I hadn’t fully considered how this design would extend to multi-account and logging from day one.

## How I debugged / fixed it
- Reviewed each security group rule in the AWS console against the intended traffic flows.
- Removed broad 0.0.0.0/0 rules and tightened SGs so only required ports between tiers were open.
- Captured a “next time” note to plan multi-account and logging at the very beginning.

## Notes / next steps
- Next day: add internet gateway, NAT gateways, and route tables; validate that the DB tier has no internet paths.
