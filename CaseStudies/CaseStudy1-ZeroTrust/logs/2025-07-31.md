# 2025-07-31 – Terraform, routing, and NAT

## What I worked on
- Added an internet gateway and high-availability NAT gateways (one per AZ) in Terraform.
- Created and associated route tables for public, private, and database subnets.
- Updated security groups so web can reach app, app can reach db, and db is isolated from the internet.
- Verified the design visually using the VPC and route table views in the AWS console.

## Issues I ran into
- Left an unintended 0.0.0.0/0 route from a DB subnet to the internet in one of the route tables.
- Over-tightened SG rules at one point and broke app → db traffic, even though routes were correct.

## How I debugged / fixed it
- Used the AWS route tables view to inspect every subnet.

## Notes / next steps
- Next day: integrate Checkov and add automated validation of security groups, routes, and internet exposure.
