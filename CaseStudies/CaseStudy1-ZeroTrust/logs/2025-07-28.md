# 2025-07-28 – Project setup & AWS account

## What I worked on
- Created/verified the AWS account to use for Cloud Fortress Prime and the Zero-Trust VPC work.
- Set up an IAM admin user with MFA and stopped using the root user for day-to-day work.
- Installed and configured the AWS CLI and authenticated it with the new IAM user.
- Created or cleaned up the GitHub repo that will hold Terraform code and case study documentation.

## Issues I ran into
- The AWS CLI initially pointed at the wrong account/profile.
- Spent time deciding how to store AWS credentials and config securely on my machine.

## How I debugged / fixed it
- Used named profiles in ~/.aws/credentials and confirmed with aws sts get-caller-identity.
- Chose a standard pattern (AWS profiles + MFA, no hard-coded keys in shell config) and wrote it down for reuse.

## Notes / next steps
- Next day: configure a remote Terraform backend (S3 + DynamoDB) so all future infra is tracked as code.
